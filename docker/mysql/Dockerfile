# We want to bake the database state into the image, as it saves ~30 seconds on
# first start up. To do this, we run the default entry point script with `mysqld` as
# first argument, as this kickstarts the database initialisation. But this also forces
# `mysqld` to start after database initialization, which we don't want. So we automatically kill
# the process after 180 seconds, which should be enough time to initialize the database.

#
# I am a little unsure about the next bit, but it works:
# Multi-architecture builds will execute this within the same build environment,
# which means each architecture needs to host their `mysqld` on their own port
# otherwise one of the two will error during the build process as the port is already taken.
